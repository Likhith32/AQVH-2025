🌍 ClimateChain: A Quantum-Secured, Verifiable Climate Data Platform

Problem Statement Title: Cryptographic Proof Over Institutional Trust
Theme: Quantum Technologies for a Sustainable Future
Category: Software
Team ID: C-17937@238T1A0581

📌 Project Overview

ClimateChain is an end-to-end climate data integrity platform designed to restore trust in environmental science. It leverages quantum-secured encryption and a verifiable ledger to ensure that climate data is tamper-proof, transparent, and reliable.

By combining quantum randomness, blockchain-inspired immutability, and AI-driven insights, ClimateChain empowers farmers, policymakers, and scientists with trusted data to make sustainable, proactive decisions.

🔑 Core Innovations

Quantum-Secured Encryption

Uses the ANU Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) to generate cryptographic keys.

Ensures true randomness and unpredictable security beyond traditional RNGs.

Verifiable Data Ledger

A lightweight, blockchain-inspired system that maintains an auditable history of all climate data records.

Guarantees immutability and transparency.

Actionable AI Insights

Transforms secured data into predictive models (e.g., drought-risk scoring).

Provides real-time, actionable intelligence for communities.

⚙️ Technical Approach

Frontend: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript

Styling & UI: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Framer Motion

Data Visualization: Recharts

Backend & APIs:

Next.js API Routes

Custom Node.js/Express Ledger Service

ANU QRNG API (for true quantum randomness)

OpenWeatherMap API (for live climate data)

Implementation Flow:

Collect climate data via OpenWeatherMap API.

Generate encryption keys using ANU QRNG API.

Secure data with quantum-level cryptography.

Store records on a verifiable ledger.

Deliver AI-powered drought-risk predictions to end-users.

✅ Feasibility & Viability

Hackathon-ready MVP: Leverages robust third-party APIs to minimize backend complexity.

Custom Ledger: Lightweight and time-efficient alternative to full blockchain systems.

Fallback Mechanism: If the QRNG API fails, a pseudo-random generator ensures demo stability.

🌱 Impact & Benefits

Farmers & Communities: Real-time, reliable drought-risk predictions for better planning.

Scientists & Policymakers: Data integrity ensures evidence-based decision-making.

Economic: Increases credibility in carbon markets and boosts trust in conservation projects.

Social: Builds public trust in environmental science.

Environmental: Establishes a global standard for transparent climate data.
