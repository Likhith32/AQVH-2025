🌍 ClimateChain: A Quantum-Secured, Verifiable Climate Data Platform

Problem Statement Title: Cryptographic Proof Over Institutional Trust
Theme: Quantum Technologies for a Sustainable Future


📌 Project Overview

ClimateChain is an end-to-end climate data integrity platform designed to restore trust in environmental science. It leverages quantum-secured encryption and a verifiable ledger to ensure that climate data is tamper-proof, transparent, and reliable.

By combining quantum randomness, blockchain-inspired immutability, and AI-driven insights, ClimateChain empowers farmers, policymakers, and scientists with trusted data to make sustainable, proactive decisions.

🔑 Core Innovations
Quantum-Secured Encryption

Utilizes Qiskit-based Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) to produce cryptographic keys.

Ensures true randomness and unpredictability, going beyond classical RNGs.

Randomness validated using entropy analysis and chi-square tests.

Verifiable Data Ledger

A lightweight, blockchain-inspired system that maintains an auditable history of all climate data records.

Guarantees immutability, traceability, and transparency.

Actionable AI Insights

Secured data is transformed into predictive models (e.g., drought-risk scoring).

Provides real-time, actionable intelligence for farmers and communities.

⚙️ Technical Approach

Frontend:

Next.js 14, React, TypeScript

Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Framer Motion

Recharts for data visualization

Backend & APIs:

Flask (Python) for backend and APIs

Custom Ledger Service (lightweight blockchain-inspired)

Qiskit libraries for true quantum randomness

OpenWeatherMap API for live climate data

Implementation Flow:

Collect climate data via OpenWeatherMap API.

Generate encryption keys using Qiskit-based QRNG.

Validate randomness using entropy and chi-square tests.

Secure data with quantum-level cryptography.

Store records on a verifiable ledger.

Deliver AI-powered drought-risk predictions to end-users.

✅ Feasibility & Viability

Hackathon-ready MVP: Leverages Flask, Qiskit, and OpenWeatherMap to minimize complexity.

Custom Ledger: Lightweight and efficient alternative to full blockchain.

Fallback Mechanism: If QRNG fails, a pseudo-random generator ensures demo stability.

🌱 Impact & Benefits

Farmers & Communities: Real-time, reliable drought-risk predictions for better planning.

Scientists & Policymakers: Tamper-proof climate data supports evidence-based decisions.

Economic: Enhances credibility in carbon markets and conservation projects.

Social: Restores public trust in environmental science.

Environmental: Establishes a transparent global standard for climate data integrity.
